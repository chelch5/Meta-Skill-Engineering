# Workflow

The default workflow for `__PROJECT_NAME__` is:

1. spec intake
2. ticket selection
3. planning
4. plan review
5. implementation
6. code review
7. security review when relevant
8. QA
9. handoff and closeout

Rules:

- do not skip plan review
- do not start implementation without an approved plan
- do not close a ticket until artifacts and state files are updated
- keep the autonomous flow internal to agents, tools, and plugins
- keep ticket `status` coarse and queue-oriented: `todo`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review`, `qa`, `done`
- keep plan approval in `.opencode/state/workflow-state.json`, not in ticket status
- treat `tickets/BOARD.md` as a derived human view, not an authoritative workflow surface
- write stage artifact bodies with `artifact_write` and then register them with `artifact_register`
- require a registered stage artifact before advancing to the next stage

## Stage Proof

- before plan review: a `planning` artifact must exist
- before implementation: `approved_plan` must be `true`
- before code review: an `implementation` artifact must exist
- before QA: a review artifact must exist
- before closeout: a `qa` artifact must exist
